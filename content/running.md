 - Effect Lights
 - Fazer

## Pre-Service Startup
Before a service there are a few things that should be done.
 - Check to make sure everything is on and working (focus lights, turn things on and off, make sure everything responds as expected)
 - Check intensities of cues being used (sermon, stage left, stage right, etc.)
 - Usually best to start with intensities at 50% and then turn up/down when people get up and see what looks best

## House Lights
There are a few different options for house lights.
 - `All` is what should be used for sermon, greeting, and if you need lights in the entire room.  The intensity of this cue is controlled using dial #14
 - `Worship` is what should be used during worship.  It keeps lights on the side brighter in the back to dark in the front.  The intensity of this cue is not able to be faded and should not be, without windows this doesn't change week to week.
 - `Left/Right/Center` gives you control of the left section, center section, and right section on 3 dials.  The center is dial #14, left dial #15, and right dial #16.
 - `Stage Only` turns on the four lights on stage.  This one is only when someone needs lights on stage for setting things up, this is never used during a service.
 - `Sound Booth` turns the lights on just above the sound booth, and can be dimmed using dial #14.  This is not used during a service.

## Stage Left/Right Lights
Stage Right and Stage Left (sometimes labeled something else for convenience such as interview) will only light up their respective sides of the stage.  These should be checked the morning they are used to ensure they are focused correctly and also to set the intensity to be used based on who is in that position.

## Front Lights
Front lights are setup on faders 1-4 to allow for multiple individual front light control.  The lead singer should be lit up the most and backup singers should be lit up a little as well when they are singing. When the song builds the entire band should lit up, but don't necessarily need to be lit up the same amount.

## Back Lights
Usually the backs will be turned up at the beginning of a song and normally left on the entire song.  Some songs are best for leaving the back lights low and bringing them up when the song builds.

## Effect Lights
We have multiple effect lights, each will be discussed in turn below.  Effect lights are normally only turned on during certain parts in a song such as during builds.  One important fact to remember is that effects shouldn't be used too much, for a start consider only one or two effects per song, with some songs not using effects at all.  Looking at videos online is a good way to get ideas and what others use for effect lighting.

 - Mac 101s (Martins) | These lights used to be the front lights in the old building, but we are using these for effect lights now.  The Mac 101s have a few different focuses and look best when shining through faze.  These are not normally used during the entire song but are brought up during builds and
