- [Step by Step Guide](#step-by-step-guide)

## Front Focus Logic

The front lights have multiple cues.  One for the focus, which is in the focus group, and multiple ones for the intensities which correspond to lead 1-4, lead ee(everyone else), sermon, stage left/right/center/etc.  The reason this is split out is so that focus can be set independent of the light intensity.  In order to set the focus of the front lights you need to first turn on the cue that turns the light on so that you can see where you are focusing the light, then focus the light in the focus cue.  Follow the steps below for the best process.

## Step by Step Guide

### Band Focus

1. In live tab, turn on lead 1-4
2. Repeat the following steps for lead 1-4 (lead 1 will be used for example, substitute lead 1 for the item you're working on)
  A. On board (Layer A), turn up fader for lead 1
  B. In edit tab, click on lead 1
  C. Ensure correct light is being used (you want the light most directly in front of the lead)

    - If incorrect light is on, click on the light that is on and click off button to turn off dimmer
    - Click light you would like to turn on for this lead, and move the dimmer fader on screen up to `65`

  D. Click on band focus
  E. Make sure the light you are focusing is the only one selected
  F. On board (Layer B), turn the dial all the way up for the light you are focusing
  
    - This will make it as narrow as possible and ensure you are in the right spot
